This is an attempt to set up a simple check of who I'm following.
It's also my first real attempt to do stuff with the python twitter module.

Constructive critique is always welcome, my programming style is decidedly quirky I'm sure.
If I'm doing it wrong, let me know!

Note: 
I'm already seeing odd behaviour with Twitter's API.  It seems the friendlist returned by the API isn't always complete.
It's rather frustrating and may make this script completely and utterly useless!
