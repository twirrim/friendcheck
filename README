This is an attempt to set up a simple check of who I'm following.
It's also my first real attempt to do stuff with the python-twitter module.

Constructive critique is always welcome, my programming style is decidedly quirky I'm sure.
If I'm doing it wrong, let me know!

To use:

You will require the python-twitter module from pypi (not the twitter module), which you can grab using pip or easy_install in the usual manner

To use this you'll need to register an application with twitter for now, until I figure out the proper approach.

https://dev.twitter.com/apps -> create a new application

Once you've done that you'll need to set the values in the friends.cfg file from the values you find on the page, and choose a file for the database to be stored in.

Your first run will initialise the database with your current set of followers.  Future ones will add any new followers and report any discrepencies
